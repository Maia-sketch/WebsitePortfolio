	 <br><h1>Short Info about me</h1></br>
     <p style="font-weight: bold">Hello and welcome to my portfolio site</p>
	 <p style="font-weight: bold">I am Maia and I am a games design student. Here I will be putting any 3d models, my coding and any drawings and sketches as well as game ideas on here. I hope to become a games writer and create good stories that entice the player and create a world<p>
	 <p style= "font-weight: bold">This website will hopefully show my ideas for different games</p>
	 <br><h2> What I want to do in games industry</h2></br>
	  <p style="color: rgb(29,137,219)"</p>
	 <p style="font-family: Times New Roman">I want to be a games writer that creates innovative story telling and new story ideas that creates a stroy the player can get into. There are many stories that can be very predictable such as Mario as he always rescues Princess Peach. I want a story that keeps the player on their toes and and to be surprised as they play through the game.</p>
